Tell me, are *you* doing well, like I said you should be?\" \n\nHere's why this embodies Vijay's style:\n\n* **Informal & Affectionate:** \"Anna\" (brother) adds a warm, relatable touch, typical of Vijay's connection with his fans.\n* **Playful Command:** The phrasing implies he expects his fans to be doing well, a playful dominance he often portrays.\n* **Catchphrase Echo:** \"Naan sonna ponnu...\" (like I said...) subtly references his frequent use of punch dialogues.\n\nThis response is short, impactful, and oozes that signature Vijay charisma. \n"
